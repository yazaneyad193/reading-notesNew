1. **CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheet**, Cascading means that it will apply rules as a flow (from top to bottom) and we use it to **represent a page as we would like**.
2. CSS works by selecting something (Element / class) then apply the rules to it, so it contains **selector and declaration**.
3. **Properties** used in CSS such as color, background-color, border, margin, etc..
4. Introduced to the **box model** concept, in short words there is an imaginary box around each element.
5. Introduced to different types of **colors** such as, **color names(blue)**, **RGB(253, 102, 320)**, **HEX(#32a852)**.
